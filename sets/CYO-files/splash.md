**<p style="text-align: center;">Choose destiny. Choose fate. Choose your own path.</p>**

Welcome, traveler, to the lands of Yor-Om. A realm beset by peril but rich in opportunity. A world soaked in fantasy and adventure. A manifold path awaiting your choices as you make your way through its twisting tale. Will you bend the knee to the great Thuul the Beastmaster and her animalistic legions? Will you seek out the skeletal wyrm Skalathak and end his undying reign of terror? Will you face the onslaught of Chaos or risk life against unlife as you hunt the archlich Hargau? All of these paths and more await you, traveler, as the land of Yor-Om invites you to choose your own adventure.

**Chronicles of Yor-Om is a draftable premier set using Play Boosters, containing 271 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 100 uncommons, 81 commons, 5 three-colour taplands, and 5 basic lands). Bundle purchasers will also obtain a promotional alternate art copy of Hargau, Archlich.

##Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/Rzch1W8/Booster.png "CYO booster"/>In addition to its focus on three-colour "arcs", the mechanics of **Chronicles of Yor-Om** include:

**Foreshadow:** Threats loom large in Yor-Om, and early pages will hint at the challenges yet to come in your adventure. A creature cast for its foreshadow cost is telegraphing its inevitable and dramatic arrival--it enters the battlefield as a noncreature artifact and will not be a creature until you remove the last time counter from it, one per turn, until its chapter of the story opens.

**Manuscripts:** Books of legend and tales of adventure, Manuscripts are a new artifact type representing the branching stories of Yor-Om. A Manuscript will always have a base effect at first, and two further options to add effects--but only one of these options can be chosen per Manuscript. Choose wisely how your Manuscript ends.

**Experience:** As you wind your way through the lands of Yor-Om, you may need to test your mettle, your wits, or your strength in order to proceed. Will you fail ignominiously or thrust forward in victory? For a creature to make an experience check, you have the choice to exile a card from your graveyard with mana value greater than that creature's power. If you can't, nothing happens. If you can, and choose to, then put a +1/+1 counter on the creature to represent its improved prowess.

**Narrative:** Your choices will write your story page by page. Narrative is an ability word representing effects which trigger whenever you cast a split spell (a spell represented by two halves of a card, such as Hero's Wrath // Wyrm's Wrath) or a modal spell (a spell whose effects ask you to choose options from a bulleted list). Be careful, because permanents with modal "enters the battlefield" triggers will not be affected here--by the time they're asking for your choice they're no longer spells.

**Entwine:** Returning from *Mirrodin* block, entwine allows you to forgo the rigors of choice. If you can pay a spell's entwine cost as an additional cost when casting it, you no longer need to choose from among its modes--instead, you can get them all at once. Some effects may also care about entwined spells or about paying entwine costs.
