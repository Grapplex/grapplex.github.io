**<p style="text-align: center;">Revisit the shores of imagination.</p>**

The **Reimagined Series** is a collection of Magic: The Gathering sets spread across multiple blocks, a loose banner of premier sets with one aim in common—to recapture and reinterpret the feel of Magic's earliest years. Each Reimagined set tells, in its own way, the story of one of the eight pre-modern blocks in Magic's history—whether that means remaking its original story, telling new tales within that world, or setting the scene for what we know would come to pass. Using modern design principles and up-to-date approaches to set building, each Reimagined set straddles both the past and present to recapture a moment in time.

The full range of **Reimagined Series** sets are:

**The Eternal Ice**: Telling the story of Dominaria's frozen past as seen in *Ice Age*, *Alliances*, and *Coldsnap*.

[**<p style="color:blue">Jamuraa: The Mirage War</p>**](https://grapplex.github.io/previews/JMR): A new vision of war. Revisiting *Mirage*, *Visions*, and *Weatherlight*, *Jamuraa: The Mirage War* retells the story of the eponymous conflict as mages and empires vie for control of Dominaria's most coveted treasure.

[**<p style="color:blue">Rath and Storm</p>**](https://grapplex.github.io/previews/90S): There is no storm such as this. Occurring concurrently with the story of *Tempest*, *Stronghold*, and *Exodus*, we return to the world of Rath to follow an assault upon the impenetrable stronghold of the ruthless evincar Volrath.

[**<p style="color:blue">Urza's Chronicle</p>**](https://grapplex.github.io/previews/URZ): A legacy generations in the making. Highlighting the block of *Urza's Saga*, *Urza's Legacy*, and *Urza's Destiny*, a collection of historic legends, sagas, and artifacts recount the depth and breadth of Urza's machinations against Phyrexia.

**Mercadia: Blood and Gold**: Setting the stage for the world of Mercadia's downfall, *Mercadia: Blood and Gold* recounts the block of *Mercadian Masques*, *Prophecy*, and *Nemesis*.

[**<p style="color:blue">Overlay</p>**](https://grapplex.github.io/previews/OVR): Worlds collide. A saga ends. Retelling the story of the Phyrexian invasion and Rathi overlay seen in *Invasion*, *Planeshift*, and *Apocalypse*, *Overlay* is a multicolour maelstrom of Dominaria's most ardent defenders.

**Otaria**: Encapsulating the sets *Odyssey*, *Torment*, and *Judgment*, the post-apocalyptic world of *Otaria* emerges from the scars of the Phyrexian invasion to start afresh—haunted by the wapring spectre of the coveted Mirari.

**The Madness of Ixidor**: Covering the block of *Onslaught*, *Legions*, and *Scourge*, the pulsating madness of the Mirari has infected Otaria, and the devolving landscape finds itself shaped by the grief and fury of the illusion-mage Ixidor.
