*Heartland of the Real* picks up where *[Project Starlight](https://grapplex.github.io/previews/FBI)* left off on the paranoid plane of St. Cahand. The arrival of the planeswalker Entity X has brought the paranormal and the supernatural to a world hitherto unperturbed by magic. Driven by the fear of this Superunknown, the secretive Starlight agency, a cabal of collaborating state governments, was founded and quickly rose to become the dominant force in geopolitics across the plane. Seeking at once to suppress, explore, and exploit the growing reports of paranormal activity across St. Cahand. Their conclusions are dire: no amount of containment will stop the spread of these new laws of nature. 

The only solution is to shelter their society behind ferrocrete and adamantium and enact something truly dire. The Starlight Protocol, a world-shaping anti-magic project, may very well destroy all life on the plane. But buried beneath the stolen land of Faleset, in the impenetrable Aleph complex, the parasitic elite hope to ride out this genocide and emerge once again into a new world order, safely buried in the heartland of the real.

*Heartland of the Real* is the fourth set in the unfolding saga of the world of St. Cahand, taking place chronologically after *[Project Starlight](https://grapplex.github.io/previews/FBI)* and before *[Experiments of Skand](https://grapplex.github.io/previews/XSK)*. Watch a world hurtle towards its own extinction—watch as the phoenix burns, unsure if it will ever arise again.

*Heartland of the Real* is a draftable premier set using Play Boosters, containing 266 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 100 uncommons, 81 commons, and 5 basic lands). Bundle purchasers will also obtain a promotional alternate art copy of Sickly Gestation, while boosters have a chance to contain the promotional headliner card, a redacted-foil Yury Belyik, Astralnaut.

###Mechanics
<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:10px" src="https://i.ibb.co/v6wSmWg6/booster.png "HTL booster"/>The mechanics of *Heartland of the Real* include:

**Operations**: Secretive psyops and black-bag missions abound in the shadows of St. Cahand. Operations are a new subtype of battle, which offer an effect when the Operation enters the battlefield and again when it is defeated. Additionally, attacking an Operation with a single creature will grant that attacker menace, making it easier for lone operatives to complete their goals.

**Lone wolf**: Starlight agents operate with limited hangout, working in isolation to keep their goals secret. Lone wolf is a triggered ability which will take effect when you attack a player or permanent with a single creature, granting that creature +1/+1 until end of turn. This only counts the creatures attacking a single target—if one creature is attacking an Operation and another creature is attacking your opponent, either will be eligible targets for a lone wolf trigger.

**Foretell**: Portents hang heavy in the air as magic begins to build on St. Cahand, and superstitions and urban legends are finding their way into reality. Foretell returns from *Kaldheim*, allowing you to exile a foretold card face down from your hand in order to cast it on a later turn for a new cost; foretold cards may also gain additional abilities if cast this way.

**Regression**: Death is no longer final in light of Entity X's arrival, and ghosts of the past have started to linger. If you cast a creature for its regression cost, it gains haste, allowing it to attack immediately—however, at the beginning of your next upkeep it's sacrificed, leaving behind a 1/1 token version of itself as an echo of what once was. Use regression to double up on powerful enter-the-battlefield effects or to push through with some surprise burst damage.
