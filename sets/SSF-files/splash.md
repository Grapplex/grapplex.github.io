**<p style="text-align: center;">Journey to a time before empires were built.</p>**

Shamtar is forever on the edge of evolution, a primordial plane of megafauna and primitive civilisation. Its hunter-gatherers bask in the awe of its wild nature, learning language, culture, and technology for the first time. But their hopes for development may be quashed in their infancy when an ancient necromancer arrives to steal away the secret of fire and leave them facing the harsh winter without it.

The five tribes of Shamtar—the Lanoa, Acuna, Yanamo, Amatar, and Kuzam peoples—live in harmony, trading their knowledge and their expertise in order to survive the harsh wilderness of an ancient world. But beyond the grasp of this primitive civilisation, the wider multiverse stirs and groans as the Architect of Worlds, the necromancer Qirauz, bends his will towards recovering something lost to him millennia ago. The twisted bones and pitted steel of his terrifying form stalk the wilds of Shamtar, and the very weight of his dark presence warps the land. 

He seeks the Soul of Fire, an artifact from his past and the key to Shamtar's evolution. Its people cannot harness fire without it, and their future as a species—the future of the world itself—may be in peril if the dread necromancer recovers it for himself. Though they do not have the wisdom to understand it, the growing ember of their promising world is about to be snuffed out.

All hope may not be lost, however. The presence of Qirauz, and his theft of fire, has awakened something else on Shamtar. In a band of the aggressive trophy-hunting Amatar people, the reclusive toolcrafter Raukell has always felt different, alone, aloof from her tribe. And in the tumult of the oncoming winter, that unease within her has ignited into a planeswalker's spark. Perhaps the newfound power of this primordial artisan can save her world from the long and infinite dark.

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/YNjVvWW/Booster.png "SSF booster"/>The mechanics of **Shamtar: Search for Fire** include:

**Toolcraft:** Crafting a tool is a keyword action presenting you with a choice—hunt, or gather. Your tools may be simple equipment to arm your creatures with, or mana sources giving you a boost of colorless mana. Each time you craft a tool you can choose which of two tokens to create. Do you want to store colorless mana or arm your tribe for aggression?

**Trophy:** Ancient beasts stalk the Pleistocene landscape. Hunt them for their tusks, claws, and hides, and enchant your Human creatures from the graveyard with additional abilities. Creatures with trophy can be recast from your graveyard as an Aura in order to reuse the abilities they had in life.

**Resilience:** Creatures with resilience have many battles to fight. When a creature with resilience dies, if it had no counters on it, return it to the battlefield with a vigilance counter on it, ready to learn from their experience with renewed caution. Use this to your advantage to press home an early aggressive start without fear of losing your board.
