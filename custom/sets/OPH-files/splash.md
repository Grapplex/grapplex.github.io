**<p style="text-align: center;">Faith alone cannot withstand compleation.</p>**

Arkoph was meant to be a sanctuary. But its architect unwittingly brought with him the instrument of its destruction. In the face of an invasive threat, the aven planeswalker Akhillos created the world as a refuge for Dominarian survivors--but their tired hands, worn boots, and bloodied rags carried traces of their descendants' doom. For centuries the Phyrexian glistening oil has pervaded the world, in its earth, its water, the blood of its people, whispering half-truths of old gods and forbidden perfection. 

And now, in Arkoph's darkest hour, the mask has slipped, and things that crawled in shadow rise bold and bloody to carve filigree scripture upon the flesh of the impure. Compleation draws near.

Will you fight for blood, or fight for oil?

**Arkoph: Crisis of Faith** is a draftable premier set using Draft Boosters, containing 261 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 80 uncommons,and 101 commons).

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/SygjV03/Booster.png "OPH booster"/>**Arkoph: Crisis of Faith** is built around the truth of Arkoph's secret and heretical "old gods". Watch in horror as the glistening oil carried to the world during its creation makes its inexorable presence known. Noxious beasts and compleated minions vie to exploit unwitting cultists. Cleave to your faith before their poisonous blessings proliferate across the plane.

**Faith:** The Eagle protects; and when He does not, another martyr is born. Faith tokens are Auras that give your creatures +1/+1 and create a 1/1 white Human creature token upon death--the faithful march fearlessly into battle against the creatures of the oil, knowing that their sacrifice will only embolden others.

**Proliferate:** Returning from Scars of Mirrodin, War of the Spark, All Will Be One, and Cults of Arkoph, proliferate is a keyword action allowing you to replicate the counters on players and permanents at will. Primarily focused on +1/+1 counters and stun counters, there are some specific cards using other kinds which the children of Geesh may take interest in as well.

**Noxious:** Warped by the pervasive influence of the glistening oil, Arkoph has becomes a toxic cesspit. Creatures with noxious present your opponent with a hard choice to make--block the creature and take poison counters, or leave it unblocked and take combat damage. Either way, victory is inevitable under the searing gaze of the Father of All.

**Compleat:** Phyrexia wastes nothing; not flesh and not opportunity. Creatures with compleat can continue to serve the the Father of Machines in death--paying that creature's compleat cost and exiling it from your graveyard allows you to create a token copy of it, although the token is now a Phyrexian artifact creature, shorn of the weakness of flesh.

**Alchemy:** Forbidden magicks crackle and coruscate across the tainted sky, as the weakening grasp of the Inquisition leaves sorcerors and warlocks to practice with impunity. Alchemy allows you to cast your spells with a discount, by tapping a single creature as you cast them and reducing any generic mana in that spell's cost by the creature's power. Know when to attack and when to cast, and repel the invasive threat with forbidden alchemy.

**Exploit:** Life was always cheap on Arkoph, and the cultists of Yog--now grasping the true nature of Yawgmoth--are quick to spend it freely. Exploit returns from Dragons of Tarkir and Innistrad: Crimson Vow, and allows you to sacrifice a creature to power up a spell. Perhaps the faithful are your fodder, or perhaps a willing supplicant wishes to be compleated in death.
