**<p style="text-align: center;">Worlds collide. A saga ends.</p>**

An invasion has begun on Dominaria. Phyrexian portal ships rip the sky apart; sleeper agents awaken; flowstone seeps across the land as two planes come together. Crovax, the ascendant Evincar of Rath, marshals his forces while the cunning general Tsabo Tavoc leads the spearhead. The Ineffable, the Father of Machines, Yawgmoth will finally know dominion over the world that scorned him millennia ago.

This was all foreseen. Plans within plans are spinning into fruition, the planeswalker Urza having laid the groundwork for Dominaria's defence generations past. A bloodline will end. Machines will walk. A legacy beckons. Apocalypse is at hand. 

**Overlay** (©2000) is a 276-card expert-level expansion for Magic: The Gathering, the thrilling culmination of the Weatherlight Saga begun three years ago at the end of the Mirage block.

Containing 81 commons, 100 uncommons, 60 rares, 20 mythic rares, and 25 basic land-rarity cards, alongside 10 randomly-inserted Special Guest reprints, Overlay explores the Phyrexian invasion of Dominaria—expect to see Yawgmoth's ancient plans come to fruition, and the coalition of Dominaria rally to save their storied plane. Will Urza's Bloodline Project bear fruit? Will madness take the last of Crovax's mind? Battle across the Song of Dominia with the coalition, defiance, and grand evolution mechanics to determine the fate of Magic as we know it.

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/N6NXj4ZL/Booster.png "OPH booster"/>**Overlay** is a heavily multicolour-focused set, and in addition to its themes of colours working together, includes the following mechanics:

**Defiance:** The races of Dominaria will not give up without a fight, always capable of rising to the challenge in front of them. Whenever you cast a spell, if its mana value is greater than the power of a creature with defiance, put a +1/+1 counter on that creature. The longer the battle rages, the more defiant your creatures may prove to be.

**Coalition:** All of Dominaria must work together if it is to survive. The coalition of Dominaria represents all the colours of magic, and effects which track the number of colours in your coalition grow depending on the number of colours among permanents you control. Each permanent can only contribute one of its colours, so diversifying your presence will increase your strength.

**Grand evolution:** The Phyrexian Scriptures have spoken of this day. Lowly machines will rise in the glory of the Ineffable, and things will walk which ought to crawl. Artifacts with grand evolution can become creatures for an additional cost, their size indicated by the grand evolution value of the card. Marked with +1/+1 counters, your newly-animated artifacts may find further synergy in the set.
