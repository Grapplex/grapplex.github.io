**<p style="text-align: center;">… It's Gleeb.</p>**

The world of Balb is a thriving, teeming, metro—well, no. Balb is certainly a world, though. And like all worlds it has its people, and like most yoghurts it has its culture. A world of indifferent and, frankly, incompetent gods, Balb is home many faiths and religions giving worship to figures as diverse as the vain and preening Lady Elandra, the barbarian god Korhm—who is certainly bigger than you—or the spooky and altogether kooky spirit of Winterisle. 

But our story follows the put-upon Gleeb, greatest (and only) cleric of the ancient cosmic horror Blugu. The time is right; the stars have aligned; his takeaway has just been delivered—the ritual is ready. Only Lord Blugu has declined to respond to the summons of his faithful servant. Scorned, disappointed, and a bit bored, Gleeb now sets out across the world of Balb, eager to find a new faith, a deity who will listen to his prayers and heed his supplications. Join Gleeb as he treks out across a land of strangers, creeps, weirdoes, and the children of lesser gods.

**Children of Lesser Gods** is a draftable premier set using Play Boosters, containing 266 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 100 uncommons, 81 commons, and 5 basic lands). Bundle purchasers will also obtain a promotional alternate art copy of Throne of Blugu.

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/CpSL5VF5/Booster.png "CLG booster"/>**Children of Lesser Gods** is focused on three-colour "wedge" factions, features the following mechanics. Each mechanic exists in a two-colour enemy pair, and each faction focuses on the two mechanics its constituent colours cover.

**Beckon the Moon:** The moon is a beautiful thing to the people of Balb; a coy and furtive mistress who none have yet kissed. Beckoning the moon is a keyword action that presents you with two choices; you may put a +1/+1 counter on a creature you control, or remove two existing counters from among creatures you control to create a 3/3 Spirit token with flying. The choice is yours; are the moon's blessings upon you? Beckon the moon is the white-black mechanic.

**Undying:** Returning from *Dark Ascension*, undying allows your creatures another crack at life (or what passes for life). When a creature with undying dies, if it had no +1/+1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it. Undying is the red-white mechanic.

**Mumbo jumbo:** Fake it until you make it, so sayeth the bey. As long as the spell sounds magical that's more than enough to work. Spells with mumbo jumbo can have their cost reduced by exiling cards from your graveyard while you cast them. Each card type exiled this way pays for one generic mana of the spell's cost, although each card exiled can only contribute one of its types—put some thought into your multi-type cards to maximise their impact. Mumbo jumbo is the green-blue mechanic.

**Casualty:** You can't make an omelette without killing a few chefs these days. When casting a spell with casualty N, you may sacrifice a creature with power N or greater—if you do, you'll get a copy of the spell. Know when your minions, goons, thugs, oiks, and mooks are expendable enough to cash in for another spell effect. Casualty is the blue-red mechanic.

**Legacy:** Death is only the beginning on Balb. Creatures with legacy can inspire others in their wake—by paying the legacy cost and exiling the card from your graveyard, you can put a number of +1/+1 counters on another creature equal to the card's legacy value; additionally, the creature gaining the counters will also gain the legacy card's relevant abilities for that turn, often allowing an evasive attack or additional attack-related bonuses. Legacy is the black-green mechanic.
