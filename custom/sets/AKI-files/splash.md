**<p style="text-align: center;">My word is law; and the law shows no mercy.</p>**

A gemstone shining in a wadi stream, the city-state of Akaddi is the pride of its emperor, Qamurab. Alone, he united the tribes of the desert under one prosperous yoke, and laid down law to tame a land. This empire is his legacy, his masterwork, his life's achievement. But all empires end. This is the story of Akaddi—but it is also the story of much more. Of Tytheus, and the elven kingdom of Blackwater. Of Quyrash, the Golden King, and the dream who dreamt himself. Of San Xalco, of infinite skies and endless nights. Of Shamtar and a fire extinguished before it could burn. 

This is the story of Akaddi, and of how all things fall.

**Akaddi: Empire's End** is a draftable premier set using Draft Boosters, containing 261 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 80 uncommons, and 101 commons).

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/b5kQpVL/Booster.png "90S booster"/>**Akaddi: Empire's End** features the following mechanics:

**Judgment counters:** The edicts of Qamurab are represented in gameplay by the introduction of judgment counters, a new kind of player counter used for a variety of purposes. On their own, judgment counters represent a slow bleed on the opponent—once your opponent has been given a judgment counter, they face a choice on each of their upkeeps, to pay penance or pay a tithe. For each counter, you will choose between losing 1 life or choosing an opponent to create a Treasure. You might find each turn that your choice seems simple, but those who are judged are marked for life, and choice will matter as the game proceeds. 

**Engrave:** Engrave is a keyword representing an optional casting cast found on multiple card types in Akaddi: Empire's End. Engrave N means that if the engrave cost is paid instead of the spell's usual mana cost, you will gain the additional kicker of creating a 0/0 Sculpture artifact token and distributing N +1/+1 counters among your Sculptures—perhaps you simply create a new N/N creature, or bolster your existing gallery of Sculptures equally. Engrave works slightly differently on permanent and nonpermanent spells; with it acting as an enter-the-battlefield trigger for permanents and simply another part of a spell's resolution otherwise.

**Study:** Study is a keyword action representing the influence of the learned worm Ghazuz. When a creature you control studies,  reveal the top card of your library. If that card is a noncreature, nonland card, you put it into your hand. Otherwise, put a +1/+1 counter on the creature that studied, then choose whether to put the card on the top or bottom of your library. 

**Arbitrate:** Arbitrate is a keyword action found on some cards in Akaddi, allowing the redistribution of counters. First, remove a counter from up to one target player; then give another player a counter of the same kind. Then remove a counter from up to one target creature, and give another creature a counter of the same kind. Lastly, remove a counter from up to one target noncreature permanent, and give another noncreature permanent a counter of the same kind. Move your judgment counters back to an opponent, steal the +1/+1 counters from enemy creatures, and pluck charge counters, loyalty counters or more in order to waylay their plans.
