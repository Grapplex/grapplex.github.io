**<p style="text-align: center;">A new vision of war.</p>**

Jamuraa is the precious gem at the heart of Dominaria, a glistering emerald of low sun, lush jungle, endless dunes, and high seas. But the vibrant continent is beset by the triangle of war, its storied lands now a canvas for the blood and glory of tyrants and empires.

Three great civilisations span the continent—the militant might of Zhalfir, shaped by its interweaving guilds; the theocracy of Femeref, guided by the Council of Voices; and the mercantile state of Suq'Ata, its loquacious traders the waters through which all goods flow. Jockeying for supremacy, these empires needed only a reason to come to blows—and they have been given three. Following the spoor of magic emanating from Chaza Isle, home to the planeswalker Teferi, three great mages have riven Jamuraa's harmony. The ambitious Kaervek and his legion of breathstealers have aligned with the reclusive beastmaster Jolrael, eager to reshape Jamuraa in their new image. Perhaps only the great diplomat Mangara, ancient and wise, can unite the empires of Jamuraa and break apart this triangle of war.

**Jamuraa: The Mirage War** is a draftable premier set in the Reimagined Series using Play Boosters, containing 2766 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 100 uncommons, 81 commons, and 5 basic lands). Bundle purchasers will also obtain a promotional alternate art copy of Mutoto, Soul of Uktabi, while all boosters have a chance of containing the Headliner retro-planeswalker version of Teferi, Steward of Zhalfir. Boosters also have a chance of containing a Booster Fun old frame card, either a battle or a basic land.

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/gMFkJLCF/booster.png "JMR booster"/>**Jamuraa: The Mirage War** features the following mechanic:

**Conflicts:** The empires of Jamuraa are embroiled in war on many fronts. Conflicts are a battle subtype, a no-frills approach to the card type with no additional wrinkles. Most Conflicts have an effect when the battle enters the battlefield and again when it is defeated, although a few will specify different effects to explore. Each booster pack of *Jamuraa: The Mirage War* contains at least one Conflict.

**Outflank:** Knights of the warring emmpires are renowned for their flanking skills. Outflank triggers are an evolution of "saboteur" effects, which will instead trigger when the creature attacks and isn't blocked by creatures with equal or greater power. An outflank trigger will occur if the creature is unblocked, but also if it's "chump-blocked" by a smaller creature, as your Knights are able to outflank such insufficient foes. Some effects in the set will also allow your outflank triggers to occur outside of combat; use these wisely to win the war.

**Timestream:** On Chaza Isle, the planeswalker Teferi challenges the supremacy of time itself, his magics affecting the stability of Jamuraa. Cards with timesteam represent that unstable phasing between timelines, allowing you to cast a spell for a cheaper cost—only to lose it to the time warps for a time. Casting a card for its timestream cost will cause it to phase out when it enters the battlefield, and not to phase in as normal during your next turn; you will get any "enters the battlefield" triggers as normal but your permanent will not arrive again for two turns. Manage the timeline accordingly to maintain supremacy. 

**Amass:** Returning from *War of the Spark*, amass represents the massed armies waging war across Jamuraa—be they Zhalfirin soldiers, Kaervek's breathstealers, or the zealots of Femeref. To amass N, put N +1/+1 counters on an Army creature you control—and if you do not control one, first create a 0/0 Army token. Your Army will grow large, but not wide, so protect it accordingly and beware of forces seeking to outflank it. Unlike previous incarnations of the mechanic, amass in *Jamuraa: The Mirage War* does not specify an additional creature type, so your Army token is not a Zombie, Orc, or anything else.
