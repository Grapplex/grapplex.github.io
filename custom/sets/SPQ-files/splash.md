**<p style="text-align: center;">Beyond time. Beyond space. Beyond our SFX budget.</p>**

Worlds of possibility float in utter isolation like scattered jewels upon a pall of velvet. Join the brash space captain Flash Byrn, a man who puts the fool in foolhardy, as he careens those glittering jewels across the night sky like snooker balls. Joined by the dry and cutting Tura the Motorpsycho and piloting the impossible spacecraft *Paradise Seven* (after *Paradise Six* was lost in a freak parallel parking accident), Flash bumbles his way across an infinite galaxy of rampaging robotrons, scurrilous scientist, and alliterative aliens as he bring you... *Tales from the Grave in Space!* 

**Tales from the Grave in Space** is a draftable premier set using Play Boosters, containing 281 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 100 uncommons, 81 commons, 10 basic land-rarity taplands and 10 basic lands). Bundle purchasers will also obtain a promotional alternate art copy of Apoblap, Fobosian Warlord, while boosters have a chance to contain the promotional headliner card, a serialised alternate-art All Yesterday's Tomorrows.

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/w7SdfJF/Booster.png "TGS booster"/>The mechanics of **Tales from the Grave in Space** include:

**Mindmeld:** Let me teach the secrets of the Fobosian brain-beam. Creatures with mindmeld can lend their strength and talents to your attacks. Mindmeld is static ability which allows you to tap a mindmeld creature at the beginning of combat to grant a temporary stat boost to another creature, as well as giving it the mindmeld creature's relevant abilities--load up some interesting attack triggers on your evasive attackers, or pile up stat boosts on your best blocker, the choice of how to mash those brains together is yours.

**Refine:** No technology is so advanced that a hapless gremulon can't turn it into a paperweight. Refine functions similar to exploit from the *Dragons of Tarkir* expansion, allowing you to sacrifice an artifact when a creature with refine enters the battlefield, triggering an ability when you do so. Many of these creatures are also artifacts themselves, offering some modality if you need it to sacrifice itself in a pinch for a spell effect.

**Warpjump & Interstellar:** We thought space was the final frontier. Then we discovered hyperspace. Functioning similarly to Lessons and Learn from the *Strixhaven: School of Mages* expansion, Interstellar spells can be cast from outside the game whenever an effect instructs you to warpjump. However, be warned, the window to hyperspace is unstable--when you warpjump you will need to cast the spell then and there, so be sure to think of Interstellar spells as powerful and flexible late-game finishers.
