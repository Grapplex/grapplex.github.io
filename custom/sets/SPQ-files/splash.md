**<p style="text-align: center;">Those who are about to die salute you.</p>**

All roads lead to Avicta. Gleaming marble and bloodstained earth alike form the capital of the great Avictan Empire, its legions pushing ever outwards in provinces north, south, east and west, while its scheming political classes entertain the population with savage bloodsport in the arena. Avicta is a culture of glory and history; of war and ruthlessness. It knows days of gold and days of rust and iron. In the wake of the questionable death of Emperor Gaio, his successor Caesar has taken the imperial laurels and seeks to expand his realm with little regard to mercy or diplomacy. 

All roads lead to Avicta, but some are paved with marbled glory. Others, with nothing but death.

**Avicta: Ave Imperator** is a draftable premier set using Draft Boosters, containing 266 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 80 uncommons, 101 commons, and 5 basic lands). 

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/6YQYwY0/Booster.png "SPQ booster"/>The mechanics of **Avicta: Ave Imperator** include:

**Imperium:** Take control of the empire and pursue your enemies with the strength of the legions. When a card instructs you to take imperium, you assume a game state which continues until the next time you end a turn without either casting a creature spell or attacking. While you hold imperium, each creature you cast enters the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter, pressing your advantage ever further; additionally, some other cards will power up during this state in a threshold effect. Grab the reins of power and command the empire.

**Arms:** Both gladiator and legionary alike must hold fast to their sword, spear, and shield. Arms tokens represent a range of equipment, created by a variety of card effects in order to keep your creatures equipped--a creature can only hold one Arms at a time, so choose wisely between the defensive scutum, aggressive gladius, or balanced pilum.

**Glory:** Though your life may be short in the grand arena of Avicta, or its many battlefields in the provincial limes, true glory lasts forever. Glory is a creature keyword tied to a new type of player counter--each time a creature you control with glory attacks, you gain a glory counter. These counters can then be spent on the activated abilities of creatures with glory. Press your attack and keep your options open, choosing which of your creatures has taken the moment to seize eternal glory.
