**<p style="text-align: center;">Suffer not the witch</p>**

Arkoph was a paradise. In a time before the world was made, the great eagle Akhillos gathered his flock, plucking the innocent from the path of an oncoming cataclysm and forging a sanctuary world for them, a haven far from war and invasion. Giving his life--and his planeswalker spark--to create the plane, the selfless aven sealed Arkoph off from the multiverse entirely, leaving as his legacy a world in a bottle, safe forever from the threats outside.
​
But not from the threats inside. In the generations since its formation, the people of Arkoph have come to venerate Akhillos as a creator-god, a vast and bloated church worshipping the Sacred Eagle now dominating all life on the plane. Lead by the cleric-tyrant known as the Theonomarch, and enforced by a strong and pervasive inquisition, the Church of the Eagle brooks no heresy, no heterodoxy, no apostasy. In the face of this oppressive theocracy, secret cults and sects thrive, some in zealous devotion to dark gods, some merely existing through jaded rebellion and debauched curiosity. In the city of Gevangis, in the village hinterlands, in the rotting shipwrecks of Land's End, or deep in the foul forests of the Weepwood, cultists and heretics gather in secret, forbidden tomes are read by moonlight, and blasphemous prayers are whispered in the dark.
​
Join us, little lamb, as we make merry in the many Cults of Arkoph.

**Cults of Arkoph** is a draftable premier set using Draft Boosters, containing 271 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 80 uncommons, 101 commons, and 10 basic lands).

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/jhXLGFh/Booster.png "90S booster"/>**Rath and Storm** is built around the secretive and heretical sects infesting the theocratic plane of Arkoph. Preach the holy word of the Sacred Eagle. Proliferate the many blessings of the laughing god Geesh. Make occult sacrifices to the wild power of Corvash. Invoke the shifting power of Vo'Radh. And celebrate dark sacraments in the name of Yog.

**Preach:** Preach is a keyword action involving a creature. When a creature preaches, you make a choice--either put a +1/+1 counter on it, or create an equipment token attached to it with "Equipped creature has prowess" and equip 2. Make your choice between immediate power or tomorrow's potential.

**Proliferate:** Returning from Scars of Mirrodin, War of the Spark, and All Will Be One, proliferate is a keyword action allowing you to replicate the counters on players and permanents at will. Primarily focused on +1/+1 counters and stun counters, there are some specific cards using other kinds which the children of Geesh may take interest in as well.

**Occult:** The brutal worshippers of Corvash, god of wild strength, know that only the strong prosper, and the weak will die. Occult is an alternative casting cost allowing you to cast spells at a discount if a creature you control has died this turn. 

**Invoke:** Gathered in hidden meeting places, the worshippers of Vo'Radh, the Shifting Flame, perform rituals of alchemical magic. Spells with invoke can be cast from your graveyard by tapping creatures in addition to paying the spell's cost--learn how to best manage the power of your invokers for efficient casting.

**Sacrament:** Yog, the lord of balance, understands that life exists in harmony with death, and his followers' teachings persist beyond their lifespans too. A creature with a sacrament ability has an enter-the-battlefield trigger which can be repeated by casting the creature as a sorcery spell from your graveyard.
