**<p style="text-align: center;">There is no storm such as this</p>**

Rath. The Seat of the Evincars. The staging ground for the Multiverse's greatest invasion. An artificial plane of equal parts flowstone and malice, ruled with an iron fist by Volrath, the Evincar of Rath, viceroy of the Father of Machines. Under his brutal boot-heel, the Rathi tribes, the Skyshroud elves, the tormented creatures of the Shadows, and a vast and varied plane of beasts and creatures suffer the world's hardships.

There are some who would put a stop to this. While the machinations of Urza unfold across planes and centuries, while the Skyship *Weatherlight* cuts through the air with its daring crew, and while the curse of Crovax grows day by day until its dark fruit ripens, another story twines its threads unseen. Travel back to the days of the Weatherlight Saga and live the tale of Lince *en*-Vec and Adcella of Skyshroud, two rebels of different origins whose joint mission to topple the Evincar and stop Phyrexia in its tracks has thus far gone unsung. 

There is no storm such as this. There is no malice quite like Rath.

**Rath and Storm** is a draftable premier set using Draft Boosters, containing 266 cards (20 mythic rares, 60 rares, 80 uncommons, 101 commons, and 5 basic lands).

###Mechanics

<img align="left" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/gWdWnmD/Booster.png "90S booster"/>**Rath and Storm** features the following mechanics, in addition to its storyline-oriented focus:

**Reprocess:** Phyrexia leaves nothing to waste. Everything is repurposed back within its spiralling food chain. Creatures with reprocess can be reborn again, grease-stained and glorious. Reprocess is an activated ability found on some Phyrexian creatures that allows you to pay a cost and exile that card from your graveyard to create an artifact copy of it--the body dies but the abilities live on.

**Throwback:** Think back to a time before this one. Like buyback before it, throwback is an additional cost on instant and sorcery spells that allows additional use--in this case, paying a spell's throwback cost allows you to copy it when casting it. Double up the value of your spells, and watch out for effects that reward you for casting and copying spells too.

**Noxious:** The flowstone wastes, the dark and ominous depths of Rootwater, the choking smog around the City of Traitors... Rath is a toxic and dangerous place. Nothing exemplifies this more than the Phyrexians, who have learnt to weaponise poison. Creatures with noxious present your opponent with a hard choice to make--block the creature and take poison counters, or leave it unblocked and take combat damage. Either way, victory is inevitable under the searing gaze of the Father of All.

**Beyond:** Pulled from their home planes, the Soltari, Dauthi, and Thalakos exist in the shadows between worlds, not quite on Rath, not quite off it. Beyond is a creature keyword that represents this shadowed half existence while harkening back to the shadow keyword from *Tempest* block. A creature with beyond can't be blocked unless it's being blocked by three or more creatures, or by another creature with beyond--take advantage of this to sneak some safe damage in against your opponents.
