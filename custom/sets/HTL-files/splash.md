**Heartland of the Real** picks up where [Project Starlight](https://grapplex.github.io/previews/FBI) left off on the paranoid plane of St. Cahand. The arrival of the planeswalker Entity X has brought the paranormal and the supernatural to a world hitherto unperturbed by magic. Driven by the fear of this Superunknown, the secretive Starlight agency, a cabal of collaborating state governments, was founded and quickly rose to become the dominant force in geopolitics across the plane. Seeking at once to suppress, explore, and exploit the growing reports of paranormal activity across St. Cahand. Their conclusions are dire: no amount of containment will stop the spread of these new laws of nature. The only solution is to shelter their society behind ferrocrete and adamantium and enact something truly dire. The Starlight Protocol, a world-shaping anti-magic project, may very well destroy all life on the plane. But buried beneath the stolen land of Faleset, in the impenetrable Aleph complex, the parasitic elite hope to ride out this genocide and emerge once again into a new world order, safely buried in the heartland of the real.
