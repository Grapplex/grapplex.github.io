**<p style="text-align: center;">Beneath the waves, beneath a forever clouded sky, but not beyond reach.</p>**

On the ocean world of Tytheus, it’s never safe to dive too deep. The aquatic elves of Blackwater know too well the horrors that lie buried at the bottom of the seas, and carefully monitor the expeditions of surface-dwelling humans into the depths to ensure they never stray too far. The predations of benthic leviathans and the animalistic merfolk, together with the watchful eye of Ihosk, the long-lived king of Blackwater, have so far kept the briny deeps safe enough. But the human fleets of Deepdive and Skyside, led by the brash and prideful captains Pundar and Dusath, yearn to expand the remit of the human societies clinging to the precious few rocks that make up dry land. Their steam-powered vessels plumb ever deeper in search of material wealth and the lost detritus of millennia, and Ihosk’s cunning and guile are needed now more than ever.

Ihosk’s outcast son, Shilok, has long yearned for the throne of Naggorash, desperate to fortify the elvish capital and take the fight to the humans aggressively. The warlike and impulsive prince has gathered a cadre of rebels to support his cause, and aims to usurp his tactician father. Under Shilok’s rule, the Blackwater elves would expand once more, he says—carving out an ever-growing kingdom beneath the waves to become the true and undisputed rulers of their world.

In the midst of this delicate balance, drowned bones and rusted weapons stir. The ancient necromancer Qirauz, a planeswalker of terrible and inexorable power, has turned his attention to Tytheus, hoping to reclaim a wondrous artifact from its hadean deeps. Distracted by the humans’ growing ambitions and the dissent within his own court, Ihosk’s attention has slipped, and Qirauz’s legion of the undead dredge ancient ruins and silted valleys hourly. Will they find what they seek—and will they awaken the ancient secret at the heart of the ocean?

**Depths of Tytheus** is a premier set exploring the ocean world of Tytheus, its undersea and overland empires, and the vast mineral and ecological riches of its waters. Featuring 81 commons, 100 uncommons, 60 rares,  20 mythic rares, and 5 reimagined full-art basic lands.

##Mechanics

<img align="right" width="200" height="353" style="margin:15px" src="https://i.ibb.co/GCx8zS0/booster.png" "TYT booster"/>The mechanics of **Depths of Tytheus** include:

**Energy**: Previously seen in *Kaladesh*, *Aether Revolt*, and *Modern Horizons 3*, energy counters return to depict the fecund and resource-rich nature of the oceans of Tytheus. Maintain an ecosystem of energy counters to your advantage and drown your foes in a trophic cascade as you spend your energy wisely.

**Tidal**: A high tide raises all ships. Cards with the tidal ability offer you a high tide and low tide option--cast them now for their mana cost, or wait until the late game and get twice the value by adding their tidal cost to copy that spell again. Late-game topdecks or dead draws suddenly wash ashore as recovered flotsam in the right hands.
