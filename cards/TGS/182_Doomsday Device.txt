Doomsday Device	UB	rare	Artifact	182	UB	1UB	Whenever a creature you control becomes tapped, if it isn’t being declared as an attacker, put a doomsday counter on Doomsday Device. Then if there are seven or more doomsday counters on it, sacrifice it. When you do, each player shuffles, then exiles all but the bottom seven cards of their library.			normal	TGS
